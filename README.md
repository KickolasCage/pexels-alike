# pexels-alike
A clone of [pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com) built with React, React Redux and React Router  that uses Pexels API for fetching images that also supports:
1. Saving images locally
2. Saving page state between page reloads
3. Searching for images via user queries
Since the provided API is free, assume that it can fetch only a certain number of pages each hour.
